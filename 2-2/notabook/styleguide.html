    <h1>WE KINDA STAN ANONYMOUS</h1>

    <h2>Anonymous is a Guy Fawkes-masked underground hacker group who claim to fight Government Institutions, corruption and injustice; drawing issue with power being concentrated to a small elite, they look to restore balance by making common people powerful.</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>THINK ROBIN HOOD BUT MAKE IT 21ST CENTURY.</h2>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>Anonymous is without a leader and have been referred to as a movement rather than a group, rendering them untouchable. British journalist Carole Cadwalladr once said, “If you believe in Anonymous, and call yourself Anonymous, you are Anonymous.”

    Founded in 2003, Anonymous took on a form of online ‘Hacktivism’. They have been responsible for some pretty big cyber attacks in the past, such as targeting the Church of Scientology in 2008 and Operation Payback in 2010. This involved attacks on the Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association of America (because Anonymous was “tired of corporate interests controlling the internet and silencing the people’s rights to spread information”).


    Anonymous also launched ‘Avenge Assange’ when PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa cut off their service to Wikileaks after the organisation leaked thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables. The attack cost Paypal an estimated US$5.5million.


    Anonymous attacks have been on and off since 2010, notably cyber protesting after the deaths of Michael Brown and Tamir Rice at the hands of a police officer in 2014. They have a history of supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and anti-police brutality movements.


    But, in more recent years they seem to have fallen off the public radar somewhat.</p>

    <h2>THAT WAS UNTIL THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD ON MAY 25TH.</h2>

    <div class="footnote">
      <p> As a child, I was fascinated with world maps, which were always Mercator. It wasn’t until my teenage years that I realised Greenland was not twice as large as Australia, as the Mercator projection asserts, but that Australia in reality was three times larger than Greenland. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <p class="noindent"> Anonymous posted a video titled ‘Anonymous Message To The Minneapolis Police Department’, where they stated that they’re going to “expose the crimes of the MPD to the world.” Shortly after, the Minneapolis police department website was temporarily down in a suspected cyber-attack.

      They also (epically) hacked the Chicago PD radios and played ‘Fuck the Police’ over police loudspeakers, preventing cops from communicating and stopping the protests for George Floyd in Chicago.

      The group’s return into the public eye attracted huge attention. The twitter account @YourAnonNews, believed to be associated with the Anonymous group jumped from 1.5 million followers to 6.5 million in a matter of days, and @YourAnonCentral went from 170,000 to over 6 million in the space of a week. </p>

      <h2>ANONYMOUS, TRUMP AND JEFFREY EPSTEIN</h2>
      <div class="footnote text"> <p> On the 31st of May, only days after their attacks on the police departments, Anonymous struck again - this time targeting Trump and infamous dickhead Jeffrey Epstein, and the pair’s alleged involvement in a child sex trafficking ring.</p></div>


      <p> However, this Anonymous ‘leak’ did not actually reveal any new information, these allegations already existed.

      First of the leak resurfaced old court documents of a 13 year old girl accusing Trump and Epstein of sexual assault. You can view the document here (Trigger Warning - this document discusses sexual assault of a minor).

      The woman behind this allegation went under the two pseudonyms of “Katie Johnson” and “Jane Doe.” In 2016 the woman was set to appear in a press conference with Lisa Bloom, a high-profile civil rights attorney - but the victim never showed. According to Bloom, the woman had received death threats and was afraid to show her face publicly.

      A few days later Bloom tweeted that the woman had dropped her lawsuit against Trump. The attorney followed this tweet with: “Every woman makes her own choice about what is best for her. Life’s a journey. Most of us get stronger as we get older. I respect women.”

      However, this allegation is widely contested with many believing it to be false. Skeptics attribute the fantastical and very deliberately shocking nature in which the court document is written as proof it is not real as it does not read like most other sexual assault cases do.

      There were more strange circumstances that led to further doubt about this accusation. You can read about more about these here..</p>

        <h2> In Google Earth</h2>
        <p>The Anonymous ‘leak’ also included Epstein’s little black book. Like the Trump allegations, this is nothing new, rather just a repackaged version in more accessible format. This was first discovered by the FBI in 2009 when they caught Epstein’s former house manager attempting to sell the book for $50,000. It was eventually acquired by journalist Nick Bryant in 2012, who released it in full 3 years later in 2015.

        The former house manager had made his own markings in the book as well as handwritten notes of his findings in an accompanying notepad. The FBI said these notes contained, “information material to the underlying investigation that would have been extremely useful to investigating and persecuting the case, including names and contact information of material witnesses and additional victims.” </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text w1of2">
       <p> Unfortunately the significance of Epstein’s little black book will never be known as the house manager died in 2015 without ever disclosing what the book or his markings meant.

        But while we cannot determine the validity of these ‘leaks’ we cannot forget that Epstein was a proven sex trafficker and at one point Trump was good mates with the guy. I mean, does anyone remember the comments Trump made about his buddy back in 2002…</p>

    <h2>“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” - Trump</h2>

    <div class="container">

      <div class="text w1of2">
        <p>We can also not discredit the very serious allegations of sexual assault that have been made against Trump by at least 24 other women.
  
        So to sum it up, the Anonymous leaks on Trump were not quite the nail in the coffin we were hoping for, but rather an amalgamation of some pretty damning - but pretty questionable - allegations against the President, which the hackers politely formatted into a much easier-to-read version (find the updated little black book here).

        But hey, it’s not over yet, Anonymous is still out there. Who knows? It could be me?

        It could even be you… </p>
