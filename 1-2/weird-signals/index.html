  <h1> Poetry as Texting <br> Isabel E. Kaplan, 2011</h1>

  <p>Text Message: “Im busy today. Going tmrw. When r u going? ”

Analysis: Perhaps the omission of the apostrophe in the contraction “Im” suggests that existence—conveyed by the word “am”—is not just related to identity, as the word “I’m” might suggest, but rather is so inextricably linked to identity that it is impossible to differentiate the two. This text also includes an interesting commentary on temporality. “Tmrw” takes up far less literal space on the page (er, cell phone screen) than “tomorrow,” and the absence of vowels decreases the likelihood of a reader’s potentially instinctive tendency to “hear” the word inside his or her head while reading.  “Today” is not shortened and, consequently, contains one more letter than “tmrw.” Therefore, it might be argued that the present tense, in this passage (er, text message), signifies that the present situation conveyed in the text message takes precedence over what may conditionally happen in the future. The second sentence of the message contains an additional example of the use of spelling to alter the meaning of a word. By writing “u” instead of “you,” the author devalues the significance of the Other. </p>

  <p>...Or maybe not. <br>
    Maybe the omission of vowels and apostrophes signifies nothing more than the desire to spend less time typing the message. And by maybe, I mean definitely.

  Although I doubt that text messages bear any resemblance to poems, that does not mean that Duffy is incorrect in describing poetry as a form of texting. Poetry involves vividly conveying emotions and ideas by using a limited number of words. Accordingly, text messaging might theoretically be a medium well- suited to the production and dissemination of poetry—and I would argue that it could also be well-suited to fiction as well. Great literature can be written in 140 characters or less. There’s the classic Hemingway story: “For sale: Baby shoes, never worn.” A brilliant story and only 37 characters long. And Margaret Atwood: “Longed for him. Got him. Shit.” Thirty words.</p>
