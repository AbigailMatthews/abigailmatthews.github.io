        issue #01 has taken a while to get out, and we're sorry for that.  you'll no doubt note that we have some vaguely outdated album reviews.  that's of course alright, because you can buy an album whenever the hell you want it (unless it's _arizona record_ by the silver jews which you'll never find.) we're going to strive to be more up to date, however, and we felt it was important to get out what we had as soon as possible.
